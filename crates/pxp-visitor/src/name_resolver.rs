        // 2. If the identifier is unqualified, there are a couple of different scenarios:
        //    a. The current scope contains an import that resolves to the identifier, in which case
        //       we can take that full import and insert into the map.
        //    b. The current scope contains an aliased import that resolves to the identifier, in which case
        //       we can take that full import without the alias and insert into the map.
        //    c. The identifier is referencing a named "thing" in the current namespace. If we have an Index,
        //       we can do some additional checks to see if there is anything that matches the potential name in the Index.
        //    d. The identifier references something in the global namespace. We don't need to do anything in this case and
        //       can just put the symbol directly into the map.

        // 3. The identifier is qualified â€“ again, a couple of different scenarios:
        //    a. The first part of the name references an imported namespace or "thing". In which case, we need to concatenate the identifier
        //       and import, then insert them into the map with a new symbol (this requires a mutable SymbolTable).
        //    b. The first part of the name references an aliased import. The same logic as above applies here, but with the "real" name
        //       rather than the alias.
        //    c. We're inside of the global namespace (no namespace or empty namespace {}). In this case, we treat a qualified identifier the
        //       same as a fully-qualified identifier and insert the symbol into the map as-is.
